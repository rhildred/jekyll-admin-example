Thinking of a way to make the Association's courses not only focused on needs but different from all of the other courses that are out there.  I read [Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching,  Kirschner, Sweller, Clarke](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1). It challenged a lot of what I believed to be true, particularly [Mindstorms, Seymour Papert](http://staff.kfupm.edu.sa/coe/adlogi/download/mindstorms-papert.pdf).
