Thinking of a way to make the Association's courses not only focused on needs but different from all of the other courses that are out there.  This is kind of morphing in to my reading list. So far I particularly recommend Merriënboer and the LinkedIn article at the end.

I read [Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching,  Kirschner, Sweller, Clarke](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1). It challenged a lot of what I believed to be true, particularly [Mindstorms, Seymour Papert](http://staff.kfupm.edu.sa/coe/adlogi/download/mindstorms-papert.pdf).

There is a researcher, Jeroen J. G. van Merriënboer, from the Open University of the Netherlands. He has a book and several articles on instructional design. One paper, an overview, is [here](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ca/&httpsredir=1&article=1688&context=edupapers).
