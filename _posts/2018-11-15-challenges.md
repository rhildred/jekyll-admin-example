Thinking of a way to make the Association's courses not only focus on needs but making them different from all of the other courses out there.  This thought morphed into a couple of recommended readings. So far I particularly recommend Merriënboer and the LinkedIn article at the end.

I read [Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching,  Kirschner, Sweller, Clarke](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1). It challenged a lot of what I believed to be true, particularly [Mindstorms, Seymour Papert](http://staff.kfupm.edu.sa/coe/adlogi/download/mindstorms-papert.pdf).

There is a researcher, Jeroen J. G. van Merriënboer, from the Open University of the Netherlands. He has a book and several articles on instructional design. One paper, an overview, is [here](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ca/&httpsredir=1&article=1688&context=edupapers).
