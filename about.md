This new association is the brain child of Joan Sanger and Rich Hildred. Rich is Joan's programmer for [cesandbob.com](http://cesandbob.com), a livelihood development program. Joan and Rich had the idea together for an association that would be a community of software developers and really on both sides of the make/buy decision--people who struggle with "learning moments" while working on projects that are in survival mode.

In software development survival mode, there are very few opportunities for professional development. It is our premise we can all use professional development in a new community, like this, to improve our well-being.  We would like to test this thesis by tracking participants' well-being with an annual survey. Using this data, anonomously, during thecoming year, we will offer very much needed courses and other opportunites for development. Outcomes will be evaluated by changes in your and all of our annual well-being survey results! Let's start!
