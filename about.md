This is the brain child of Joan Sanger and Rich Hildred. Rich is Joan's programmer for [cesandbob.com](http://cesandbob.com), a livelihood development program. Joan and Rich had the idea together for an association that would be a community of software developers that included people on both sides of the make/buy decision. People that struggle with "learning moments" while working on projects that are in survival mode.

In software development survival mode there are very few opportunities for professional development. It is our thesis that professional development can be done in this community to improve it's well-being.  We would like to test this thesis by tracking participants well being with an annual survey. During the year we will offer courses and other opportunites for development. Outcomes will be evaluated by change in annual well-being survey results.
