In our experience as post secondary educators, software graduates fall into 2 basic categories:

1. They go to work for a supportive boss on a great team with lots of learning and professional development.
2. They work by themselves on projects or a team that is in survival mode. Teaching moments are few and stressful.

This association is for the second category of people who develop software.
